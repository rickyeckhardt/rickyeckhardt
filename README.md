## 👋 Hi, I’m Ricky

Startup builder. Marketplace architect. Founder-engineer at **Nerdbeak**, building **Nerdbase** – an AI-powered engine that spins up vertical marketplaces for collectibles in days, not years.

First live vertical: [**Nerdworth**](https://nerdworth.com) – the art slab exchange.

### 🚀 What I’ve Done

- Built 0→1 at **7 startups**, including **BookOutdoors (acquired by Hipcamp)**, **GoCamp**, **Fitted Retail**, and **NATO iLab**
- Shipped full platforms solo: booking engines, auctions, drop systems, ML/AI tools, price engines
- Launched multiple marketplaces across travel, collectibles, and community commerce – I like to move fast and make it real

---

### 🛠 What I’m Into

- Currently building with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, **shadcn/ui**, **Prisma**, and **Supabase**
- Deep into **AI-native marketplaces** – vision models, embeddings, and real-time pricing for collectibles
- Opinionated about clean UX, sane domain models, and infra that can actually survive scale

### 🎯 Fun Stuff

Yo-yo addict, inline skater, and collector of all things slabbed, limited, or just weird enough that eBay’s search bar cries a little.
