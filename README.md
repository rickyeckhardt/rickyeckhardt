### Hi, I'm Ricky. 

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a passionate front end developer pretending to be a full stack developer who moonlights as a game developer. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on boilerstack.dev and vet.dev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on game or full stack projects that help our community. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning advanced full stack topics and C++17.
- 💬 Ask me about CSS/Sass.
- 📫 How to reach me: ricky.eckhardt@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to yo-yo. I take it serious and have an entire drawer full of them!
